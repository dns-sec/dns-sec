## Hi, I'm Dennis

I'm a junior IT-, information- and cybersecurity specialist that focuses on defensive security and practical, real-world problem solving.

I believe in resilient, understandable, and efficient security solutions without creating unnecessary friction for users or developers.

My aim is to understand threats, analyse risks, build secure environments, and apply security principles in networks, systems, and software.
