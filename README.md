## ✨ Hi, I'm Dennis ✨

</div>

I am currently studying IT-, information- and cybersecurity with a strong focus on defensive security and practical, real-world problem solving.

Secure systems interest me most when they are designed to be resilient, understandable, and efficient without creating unnecessary friction for users or developers.

My work revolves around understanding threats, analysing risks, building secure environments, and applying security principles in networks, systems, and software.
  
## Focus Areas
- Information security  
- Defensive cybersecurity
- Network security and monitoring  
- Secure system design  
- Risk management and threat analysis  
- Practical security tooling
  
## Tools and Experience
- Wireshark, nmap, Suricata, Wazuh  
- Linux and Windows hardening  
- Packet Tracer, virtualization  
- Scripting and automation when needed

#### Security should enhance productivity, not block it.
